## ‚òï More about 
I developed a comprehensive website for Arkan Seguros, a company dedicated to providing customized insurance solutions. On the website, I clearly and intuitively highlighted the various services that Arkan offers, as well as its core values ‚Äã‚Äãand mission, creating an informative and engaging experience for visitors.

In addition, I implemented an automated dashboard that analyzes the data of people who register through the online form. This advanced tool provides unique insights, allowing Arkan Seguros to better understand the profile of its customers and adjust its marketing and service strategies more effectively.

<br>
Besides that, obviously the project is 100% adaptable for mobile devices and strategy planned for future software maintenance.
